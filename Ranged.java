/**
 * The Ranged class represents a ranged enemy that attacks the player from a distance by shooting projectiles.
 * It extends the Enemy class, inheriting the basic enemy functionality, and adds a ranged attack mechanism.
 * The enemy shoots projectiles at the player when within range, with a cooldown to prevent constant firing.
 * The attack involves calculating the angle towards the player, creating a projectile, and firing it with a set damage and speed.
